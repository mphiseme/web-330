            He already has some experience in it. 
           He has created and is currently managing two websites using WordPress. 
           During the process of working on these websites he had to rely on his 
           knowledge on HTML and CSS coding.</p>
        <p class="compInfo">Throughout the years Manel has accumulated a lot of skills.
            He gathered customer service skills while working for companies like PayPal and perseverance skills while working as an intern for Gallup. 
           He has a lot of major certificates. He has a certificate from “National Career Readiness Certification” in February 2017.
            He has one from “Bring Your A Game to Work” of that same year. 
           He also has one from “Toastmasters International” in December 2016. 
           Manel is a highly motivated individual. He does not stop when faced with challenges.</p>
